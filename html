<p>I can't help my greatness I was like this at birth and because I'm so awesome I developed super powers and my super powers were also pure greatness. Even though at times my greatness is under appreciated I've forgive those ignorant minded few. Greatness is only recognized by other greatness.:)</p> <img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-djjuARi15pc/UYLkESn5PuI/AAAAAAAAAUM/533S_NA0YqU/s1600/golden-stars-on-black.jpg"width="400"height="300">
Furthermore I would like to add in some of my small but great accomplishments like saving the day when it was about to rain I had to stop it, some my wonder how I did such a great thing well let me answer that question for you I did it by simply being me.;) So take notes kids always be yourself you just might be great. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com"> Click here</a><img src="http://distilleryimage4.s3.amazonaws.com/0f40ed2cd05a11e2900c22000a1fb715_7.jpg"width="400"height="500">
